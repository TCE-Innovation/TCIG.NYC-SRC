This project aims to develop a centralized relational database for TCE to consolidate data from various applications including Procore, Bridgit Bench, Bamboo HR, and EZOffice Inventory. The current system involves complex inter-application data transfers, which this solution seeks to streamline by introducing a centralized data management system. By channeling all application data into a single database and managing distribution from this central point, we intend to enhance data accessibility, streamline management, and improve strategic decision-making capabilities across TCE. This approach shifts from horizontal data exchange between applications to a vertical integration model, where all data flows into and out of the central database.
